Map (Leaflet) Challenge

This assignment takes a geojson file from the US Geological Survey about earthquakes.  I chose to map the dataset of all USGS Magnitude 1.0+ Earthquakes over the Past Week.  The size of the circle on the map indicates the magnitude (the bigger circle = bigger magnitude) and the color corresponds to the depth of the earthquake - you can see the legend in the lower right corner that explains the color coding.  If you click on a cicle (earthquake) the map will popup additional information that includes the location, magnitude and depth.
